Note: Seems like the bytes 11 and 12 got mixed up. If they were in reverse order the sector size would correctly be 512 bytes, instead it is 2 bytes. Due to almost all other information being correctly read, we assume this is just an error.

\section{FAT Investigation}

Find out where the virus has corrupted the FAT tables and suggest a way to correct it.\\
\\
Seems like the infamous virus VirFAT has overwritten every other entry with a counter. One way to fix it would be to use the second FAT but it has also been overwritten.

\section{Investigation of Directories}

For each directory fill one of these:\\
\\
\begin{tabular}{l c r}
    \hline
    \textbf{Information} & \textbf{Offset (Size)} & \textbf{Value}\\
    Directory/File Name & ? & ? \\
    Attributes & ? & ? \\
    Creation Time and Date & ? & ? \\
    Last Access Date & ? & ? \\
    Time and Date Stamp & ? & ? \\
    Clusterâ€™s Chain in FAT & ? & ? \\
    Absolute Offset & ? & ? \\
    Size of the file & ? & ? \\
    \hline
\end{tabular}
\\
\\
\\
Also find and analyze the anomalies.
